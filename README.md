# compute-sin-x-without-math.h
This is a function that computes sin(x) using the taylor series of the function. the legal values for this program are [-25, 25], and it does not uses the library &lt;math.h>. the only usage of this library is to verify the correctness of result by printing the system function: sin(x) from math.h
